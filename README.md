My early research was on the effect of volcanic eruptions on climate during the last 400 years. I investigated the impact of explosive eruptions, such as Tambora in 1815, in general circulation models as examples of extreme external forcing. 

Since then, I've been working more on the evolution of Arctic and high- to mid-latitude climates over the last 150 years. I combine in-situ, proxy, reanalysis and model data to try to untangle puzzling features and questions. I focus especially on the changing cryosphere and its impact on atmospheric circulation patterns. This includes analysing processes ranging from daily to decadal, and from regional to hemispheric resolution. Recently, I shifted my focus a little bit to seasonal prediction, combining my background of teleconnections, climate forcings and cryosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. 

After working for the WMO to coordinate weather and climate research projects, I am currently a Swiss National Science Foundation supported researcher at the University of Bern, trying to combine historical climate reconstructions with seasonal climate prediction ideas by using machine learning tools.

Besides these scientific foci, I am highly interested in graphic and communication design. In some instances I am able to combine this interest with professional matters, such as talks, posters or figures. I often wonder about how to deliver (my) messages visually, dwelve into graphic design magazines and look out for new font types or color palettes.
